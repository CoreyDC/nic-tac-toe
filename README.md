# cageArcade

## Description

This web page is heavily inspired by admiration for Nicholas Cage and classic games. The team behind the production wanted to use our humor and skill to innovate a place to play games and laugh at the results of extreme method acting. There simply was not enough Cage fanatisism on the web. Now there is. You're welcome internet.
